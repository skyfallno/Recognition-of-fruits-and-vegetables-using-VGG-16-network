# Recognition-of-fruits-and-vegetables-using-VGG-16-network

# Description
The model is built by combining transfer learning method and VGG16 network for classification. And even better, this network already has keras framework available
The advantage of this job is that it doesn't need too many datasets
# Result
My dataset contains 10 kinds of vegetables with more than 13000 images.we got 98.95% accuracy.
